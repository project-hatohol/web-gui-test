These scripts have a condition that is setting "admin" as username and "hatohol" 
as password. If you set different username and pass in your test environment,
you edit utils.py.

And, each test ware wrote my setting. For example, zabbix IP address, Redmine API key.
When you test in your environment, you must change there setting.
